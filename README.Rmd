This mini package provides access to latin american climate risk indices at different categories. Those indices are derived from a large corpus of newspapers archives and available at monthly and daily frequency. It further provides certain climate related events (laws, legislation, presidential decrees).

The package provides three different functions. Python library `Polars` must be installed. The package can be found on PyPI under the link: [https://pypi.org/project/pyclimaterisk/](https://pypi.org/project/pyclimaterisk/)


```{python}
import pyclimaterisk as cr
```


```{python}
cr.get_monthly_data().head()
```


```{python}
cr.get_daily_data().head()
```


```{python}
cr.get_events().head()
```
